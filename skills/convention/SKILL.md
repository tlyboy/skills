# Convention

Project conventions and documentation standards.

## README

Project README must provide both English (`README.md`) and Chinese (`README.zh-CN.md`) versions, following a fixed structure:

- One `#` (H1): project name
- `{{emoji}} {{description}}` directly under H1, **kept identical in both languages** (used as GitHub repo description)
- Tech stack table (if applicable) directly under `{{emoji}} {{description}}`
- Three `##` (H2) sections as the main structure: Install, Usage, License (Chinese: 安装, 使用说明, 使用许可)
- Additional content under `###` (H3) titles within corresponding H2 sections as needed
- No other H1 or H2 sections allowed

### Example

```md
